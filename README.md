# APMP Converter GUI

A SwiftUI application for converting projected video content to Apple Projected Media Profile (APMP) format. This app provides an intuitive graphical interface for batch video conversion with drag & drop support, conversion queue management, and progress tracking.

## What This App Does

The APMP Converter GUI transforms 360째 and 180째 immersive video content into Apple's Projected Media Profile format, making it compatible with Apple's immersive media ecosystem. The app supports:

- **Monoscopic and stereoscopic video conversion**
- **Multiple projection types**: Equirectangular and half-equirectangular
- **Frame-packing modes**: Side-by-side and over-under stereoscopic layouts
- **Automatic format detection** from video metadata
- **Batch processing** with conversion queue management
- **Modern macOS design** with drag & drop interface

## How to Use

### Getting Started

1. **Build and run** the project in Xcode 16.0+
2. The app opens with a clean interface showing a file drop zone

### Converting Videos

**Method 1: Drag & Drop**
- Drag video files directly onto the drop zone
- The app will automatically detect supported formats
- Files are added to the conversion queue

**Method 2: File Selection**
- Click "Select Files" to browse for video files
- Choose one or multiple video files
- Files are added to the conversion queue

### Conversion Settings

For each video in the queue, you can configure:

- **Auto-detect**: Let the app analyze video metadata automatically
- **Projection Type**: Choose between equirectangular or half-equirectangular
- **View Packing**: Select side-by-side or over-under for stereoscopic content
- **Baseline**: Set stereo baseline in millimeters (for stereoscopic video)
- **Field of View**: Specify horizontal FOV in degrees

### Processing Videos

1. **Review** your conversion queue
2. **Adjust settings** for each video as needed
3. **Click "Start Conversion"** to begin batch processing
4. **Monitor progress** with real-time progress indicators
5. **Find converted files** in the same directory as source files (with `_apmp.mov` suffix)

## Supported Input Formats

- **Video codecs**: H.264, HEVC, and other AVFoundation-compatible formats
- **Projections**: Equirectangular (360째) and half-equirectangular (180째)
- **Stereoscopic layouts**: Side-by-side and over-under frame packing
- **File formats**: Most QuickTime-compatible video files

## Output Format

- **Container**: QuickTime (.mov)
- **Video codec**: HEVC for monoscopic, MV-HEVC for stereoscopic
- **Filename**: Original name with `_apmp.mov` suffix
- **Metadata**: Apple Projected Media Profile compliant

## System Requirements

- **macOS**: 26.0 or later
- **Xcode**: 16.0 or later for building
- **Swift**: 6.0
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon and Intel Macs supported

## Technical Notes

- This project extends the original Apple sample code from WWDC25 session 297
- Built with SwiftUI and modern Swift concurrency (async/await)
- Uses AVFoundation, CoreMedia, and VideoToolbox for video processing
- Currently processes video tracks only (audio preservation in development)

## Known Limitations

- **Audio**: Original audio tracks are not preserved in current version
- **Performance**: Processing time depends on video resolution and duration
- **Memory**: Large video files may require significant RAM during conversion

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd apmp-converter-gui

# Open in Xcode
open ProjectedMediaConversion.xcodeproj

# Or build from command line
xcodebuild -project ProjectedMediaConversion.xcodeproj -scheme ProjectedMediaConversion -configuration Release build
```
